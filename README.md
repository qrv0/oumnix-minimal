## What is it?

oumnix-minimal is an experiment in training models that **do not follow the Transformer path**.
No papers. No replicas. Just a different line of exploration.

The images below show a real training run from scratch, absolute zero (not fine-tuning) on a 50M parameter model, trained on a notebook with an RTX 4060.
Nothing here is simulated.

## Why share this now?

Itâ€™s not an announcement. Not a promise. Just an open record that **other paths exist** even outside the road paved by Transformers.
